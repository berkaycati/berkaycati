Greetings I'm Berkay. I'm a Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Student at Istanbul Technical University. Despite my area, I have a strong interest in technology, and it appears that this will lead to a total transformation in my career path. Although I will completely turn my career on this path, I also try to benefit as much as possible from the competencies I have acquired in my field.


I want to advance professionally in the field of mobile app development for iOS.
